Data Loading and Preprocessing:

    It uses the MNIST dataset, a collection of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9).
    The dataset is loaded into four variables: x_train, y_train, x_test, and y_test.
    Pixel values of the images are normalized to the range [0, 1] by dividing by 255.

Model Definition:

    It defines a simple neural network model using the Sequential API.
    The model consists of:
        A Flatten layer: Flattens the 28x28 input images into a 1D array.
        A Dense layer with 128 units and ReLU activation function.
        A Dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.2 to prevent overfitting.
        A Dense layer with 10 units (output layer, one for each digit).

Model Compilation:

    The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer, Sparse Categorical Crossentropy loss function, and 'accuracy' as a metric.

Model Training:

    The model is trained using the training data (x_train, y_train) for 10 epochs.
    Validation data (x_test, y_test) is provided for validation during training.

Model Evaluation:

    The trained model is evaluated on the test data (x_test, y_test).

Testing on Sample Images:

    It uses an external image (img_10.jpg) to test the trained model.
    The image is loaded, converted to grayscale, resized to 28x28 pixels, and normalized.
    The model predicts the digit in the image using model.predict.
    The predicted class index is obtained by finding the index with the highest probability.


In the Keras API, the Sequential model is a linear stack of layers, where you can simply add one layer at a time. It represents a linear pipeline of neural network layers, and it is suitable for a plain stack of layers where each layer has exactly one input tensor and one output tensor.

Here's a brief explanation of the Sequential model and its layers:

    Sequential Model:
        The Sequential model is a linear stack of layers in Keras.
        You can create a Sequential model and add layers to it using the add method.

    Sequential Layers:
        In a Sequential model, each layer has a single input tensor and produces a single output tensor.
        Layers can be added to the model one after the other, and Keras will automatically infer the input shape of each layer.
